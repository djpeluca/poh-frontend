 <h3>It's hard to pin one title or theme to it. <br/>It's many things and it's current embodiment is only the first show of its potential.<br/><b>Let's start with what it does.</b>.</h3>
 <!-- PÃ¡rrafos -->
 <section>
  <p>PProjects Of Humanity takes internet advertising revenue and distributes it among its users, so they in turn can distribute it according to their interests and desires related to any projects they find valuable around the globe. Projects Of Humanity was born out of the idea that the true power and worth of the internet is the creativity its users and the solidarity among them. We believe this to be the fuel that the Internet, and largely the world, runs on. Thus, one could consider us a sort of crowdfunding that allows you to donate real money to a cause through your action but without your bank account; to help further a cause by making advertisers that vie for your notice work for you and for the projects you support.</p>
  
  <p>We believe publicity and advertisement revenue belongs to the audience of their message, to those who gives their time and attention to view it, and not so much to the platform that transmits it. Thus, Projects Of Humanity aims to direct 99% of its advertisement revenue power to its users, distributed equally.</p>

  <p>But Projects Of Humanity is more than this. We believe the internet can - and should if it isn't already - be a platform for the cultural evolution of mankind. Its value is not in its media itself, but in every active person using it in this world: generating experiences, sharing new discoveries, exchanging, moulding and renewing the environment that surrounds us all. The internet imitates the world, it represents it, and where the world shapes the internet, the internet then reshapes the world.</p>

    <p>The goal of Projects Of Humanity is to generate tools to further the human cause. To venture into new challenges, to educate and inform ourselves and to share. Information, experiences, ideas; the true legacy of humanity is within each of us.</p>

   <p>Projects Of Humanity is an experiment. It's a game. It's the possibility to present our dreams and help each other chase them. In a way, we hope it may become an invitation, for everyone, to participate in a direct form of democracy to create the world of tomorrow.
